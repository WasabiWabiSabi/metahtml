\section{Introduction}

\fixme{the intro should be written last, but you should start thinking about which citations should get mentioned here}

\subsection{Contributions}

\fixme{
add the contributions;
this should be the first thing to focus on, since exactly what our contributions are will determine how the rest of the paper gets written;
but we will redo the exact wording of this when we write the intro properly}

\end{figure}

\section{Related Work}

\fixme{Find 5-20 papers that you think are related to this research.
For each paper, include the citation and 1-5 sentences explaining why that paper is important.
At this point, these summaries should just be in outline format.
Later, we will go through and put this together into a nice narrative.}

Notice the correct way to use the cite and citet commands in the following examples:

NLP is awesome \cite{Aho:72}.

\citet{Aho:72} show that NLP is awesome.

\section{The Metahtml Algorithm}

\fixme{probably you're not familiar enough with the algorithm yet to write this section, so focus on the data collection part first}

\section{Data Collection}

\fixme{this is the main section that can be written right now; 
do your best to write as much of this as you can; once you're done, we'll go over what you've written; 
probably most of it will have to be rewritten, but that's 100\% normal even for experience writers}
