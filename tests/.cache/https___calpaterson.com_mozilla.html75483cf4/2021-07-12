                <FIGCAPTION>
                    Mozilla's top exec pay has gone up hugely even as usage has
                    crashed.
                </FIGCAPTION>
            </FIGURE>
            <P>Mozilla recently announced that they would be dismissing 250 people.
            That's a quarter of their workforce so there are some deep cuts to their
            work too. The victims include: the MDN docs (those are the web standards
            docs everyone likes better than w3schools), the Rust compiler and even some
            cuts to Firefox development. Like most people I want to see Mozilla do well
            but those three projects comprise pretty much what I think of as the whole
            point of Mozilla, so this news is a big let down.</P>
            <P>The stated reason for the cuts is falling income. Mozilla largely relies
            on "royalties" for funding. In return for payment, Mozilla allows big
            technology companies to choose the default search engine in Firefox - the
            technology companies are ultimately paying to increase the number of
            searches Firefox users make with them. Mozilla haven't been particularly
            transparent about why these royalties are being reduced, except to blame
            the coronavirus.</P>
            <P>I'm sure the coronavirus is not a great help but I suspect the bigger
            problem is that Firefox's market share is now a tiny fraction of its
            previous size and so the royalties will be smaller too - fewer users, so
            fewer searches and therefore less money for Mozilla.</P>
            <P>The real problem is not the royalty cuts, though. Mozilla has already
            received more than enough money to set themselves up for financial
            independence. Mozilla received up to half a billion dollars a year (each
            year!) for many years. The <EM>real problem</EM> is that Mozilla didn't use
            that money to achieve financial independence and instead just spent it each
            year, doing the organisational equivalent of living hand-to-mouth.</P>
            <P>Despite their slightly contrived legal structure as a non-profit that
            owns a for-profit, Mozilla are an NGO just like any other. In this article
            I want to apply the traditional measures that are applied to other NGOs to
            Mozilla in order to show what's wrong.</P>
            <P>These three measures are: overheads, ethics and results.</P>
            <H2>Overheads</H2>
            <P>One of the most popular and most intuitive ways to evaluate an NGO is to
            judge how much of their spending is on their programme of works (or
            "mission") and how much is on other things, like administration and
            fundraising. If you give money to a charity for feeding people in the third
            world you hope that most of the money you give them goes on food - and not,
            for example, on company cars for head office staff.</P>
            <P>Mozilla looks bad when considered in this light. Fully 30% of all
            expenditure goes on administration. Charity Navigator, an organisation that
            measures NGO effectiveness, would give them <A href=
            "https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=48#PerformanceMetricTwo">
            zero out of ten</A> on the relevant metric. For context, to achieve 5/10 on
            that measure Mozilla admin would need to be under 25% of spending and, for
            10/10, under 15%.</P>
            <P>Senior executives have also done very well for themselves. Mitchell
            Baker, Mozilla's top executive, was paid $2.4m in 2018, a sum I personally
            think of as instant inter-generational wealth. Payments to Baker have more
            than doubled in the last five years.</P>
            <P>As far as I can find, there is no UK-based NGO whose top executive makes
            more than Â£1m ($1.3m) a year. The UK certainly has its fair share of big
            international NGOs - many much bigger and more significant than
            Mozilla.</P>
            <P>I'm aware that <A href=
            "https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/relationship-between-overheads-and-effectiveness/">
            some people dislike overheads as a measure</A> and argue that it's possible
            for administration spending to increase effectiveness. I think it's hard to
            argue that Mozilla's overheads are correlated with any improvement in
            effectiveness.</P>
            <H2>Ethics</H2>
            <P>Mozilla now thinks of itself less as a custodian of the old Netscape
            suite and more as a 'privacy NGO'. One slogan inside Mozilla is: "Beyond
            the Browser".</P>
            <P>Regardless of how they view themselves, most of their income comes from
            helping to direct traffic to Google by making that search engine the
            default in Firefox. Google make money off that traffic via a big targeted
            advertising system that tracks people across the web and largely without
            their consent. Indeed, one of the reasons this income is falling is because
            as Firefox's usage falls less traffic is being directed Google's way and so
            Google will pay less.</P>
            <P>There is, as yet, no outbreak of agreement among the moral philosophers
            as to a universal code of ethics. However I think most people would
            recognise hypocrisy in Mozilla's relationship with Google. Beyond the
            ethical problems, the relationship certainly seems to create conflicts of
            interest. Anyone would think that a privacy NGO would build anti-tracking
            countermeasures into their browser right from the start. In fact, this was
            only added relatively recently (<A href=
            "https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/">in
            2019</A>), after both Apple (<A href=
            "https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/">in
            2017</A>) and Brave (since release) paved the way. It certainly seems like
            Mozilla's status as a Google vassal has played a role in the absence of
            anti-tracking features in Firefox for so long.</P>
            <P>Another ethical issue is Mozilla's big new initiative to <A href=
            "https://vpn.mozilla.org/">move into VPNs</A>. This doesn't make a lot of
            sense from a privacy point of view. Broadly speaking: VPNs are not a useful
            privacy tool for people browsing the web. A VPN lets you access the
            internet through a proxy - so your requests superficially appear to come
            from somewhere other than they really do. This does nothing to address the
            main privacy problem for web users: that they are being passively tracked
            and de-anonymised on a massive scale by the baddies at Google and
            elsewhere. This tracking happens regardless of IP address.</P>
            <P>When I tested Firefox through <A href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla
            VPN</A> (a rebrand of <A href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</A>) I
            found that I could be de-anonymised by browser fingerprinting - already a
            fairly widespread technique by which various elements of your browser are
            examined to create a "fingerprint" which can then be used to re-identify
            you later. Firefox does not include as many countermeasures against this as
            some other browsers (<STRONG>this is a correction</STRONG> - I previously
            said Firefox contained none but it's been pointed out to me that <A href=
            "https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/01/07/firefox-72-fingerprinting/">since
            earlier this year</A> it does block some kinds of fingerprinting).</P>
            <FIGURE>
                <IMG src="assets/panopticlick-firefox.png" alt=
                "firefox's results on panopticlick - my browser has a unique fingerprint">
                <FIGCAPTION>
                    Even when using Mozilla's "secure and private" VPN, Firefox is
                    trackable by browser fingerprinting, as demonstrated by the
                    <A href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">EFF's Panopticlick
                    tool</A>. Other browsers use randomised fingerprints as a
                    countermeasure against this tracking.
                </FIGCAPTION>
            </FIGURE>
            <P>Another worry is that many of these privacy focused VPN services have a
            nasty habit of turning out to keep copious logs on user behaviour. A few
            months ago several "no log" VPN services inadvertently released terabytes
            of private user data that they had promised not to collect <A href=
            "https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-free-vpns-leak/">in a massive
            breach</A>. VPN services are in a great position to eavesdrop - and even if
            they promise not to, your only option is to take them at their word.</P>
            <H2>Results</H2>
            <P>I've discussed the Mozilla chair's impressive pay: $2.4m/year. Surely
            such impressive pay is justified by the equally impressive results Mozilla
            has achieved? Sadly on almost every measure of results both quantitative
            and qualitative, Mozilla is a dog.</P>
            <P>Firefox is now so niche it is in danger of garnering a cult following:
            it has just 4% market share, down from 30% a decade ago. Mobile browsing
            numbers are bleak: Firefox barely exists on phones, with a market share of
            less than half a percent. This is baffling given that mobile Firefox has a
            rare feature for a mobile browser: it's able to install extensions and so
            can block ads.</P>
            <P>Yet despite the problems within their core business, Mozilla, instead of
            retrenching, has diversified rapidly. In recent years Mozilla has
            created:</P>
            <UL>
                <LI>a mobile app for making websites</LI>
                <LI>a federated identity system</LI>
                <LI>a large file transfer service</LI>
                <LI>a password manager</LI>
                <LI>an internet-of-things framework/standard</LI>
                <LI>an email relay service</LI>
                <LI>a completely new phone operating system</LI>
                <LI>an AI division (but of course)</LI>
                <LI>and spent $25 million buying the reading list management startup,
                Pocket</LI>
            </UL>
            <P>Many of the above are now abandoned.</P>
            <P>Sadly <A href=
            "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2018/">Mozilla's
            annual report</A> doesn't break down expenses on a per-project basis so
            it's impossible to know how much of the spending that <EM>is</EM> on
            Mozilla's programme is being spent on Firefox and how much is being spent
            on all these other side-projects.</P>
            <P>What you can at least infer is that the side-projects are expensive.
            Software development always is. Each of the projects named above (and all
            the other ones that were never announced or that I don't know about) will
            have required business analysts, designers, user researchers, developers,
            testers and all the other people you need in order to create a consumer web
            project.</P>
            <P>The biggest cost of course is the opportunity cost of just spending that
            money on other stuff - or nothing: it could have been invested to build an
            endowment. Now Mozilla is in the situation where apparently there isn't
            enough money left to fully fund Firefox development.</P>
            <H2>What now?</H2>
            <P>Mozilla can't just continue as before. At the very least they need to
            reduce their expenses to go along with their now reduced income. That
            income is probably still pretty enormous though: likely hundreds of
            millions a year.</P>
            <P>I'm a Firefox user (and one of the few on mobile, apparently) and I want
            to see Mozilla succeed. As such, I would hope that Mozilla would cut their
            cost of administration. I'd also hope that they'd increase spending on
            Firefox to make it faster and implement those privacy features that other
            browsers have. Most importantly: I'd like them to start building proper
            financial independence.</P>
            <P>I doubt those things will happen. Instead they will likely keep the
            expensive management. They have already cut spending on Firefox. Their
            great hope is to continue trying new things, like using their brand to sell
            VPN services that, as I've discussed, do not solve the problem that their
            users have.</P>
            <P>Instead of diversifying into yet more products and services Mozilla
            should probably just ask their users for money. For many years the Guardian
            newspaper (a similarly sized organisation to Mozilla in terms of staff) was
            a financial basket case. The Guardian started <A href=
            "https://support.theguardian.com/uk/contribute">asking their readers for
            money</A> a few years ago and seems to be on firmer financial footing
            since.</P>
            <P>Getting money directly has also helped align the incentives of their
            organisation with those of their readers. Perhaps that would work for
            Mozilla. But then, things are different at the Guardian. Their chief exec
            makes a mere Â£360,000 a year.</P>

            <P>Another notable technology NGO with huge expenses is The Wikimedia
            foundation. You can read more about their problems in <A href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Guy_Macon/Wikipedia_has_Cancer">Wikipedia
            has Cancer</A> which uses a very dodgy metaphor but is otherwise a good
            study of incredible spending growth there. Wikimedia has the advantage over
            Mozilla that all contributors to its main project are unpaid - which only
            makes the expenses all the more mindblowing. Wikimedia, like Mozilla, has
            had a lot of side projects. At one point they were trying, in secret, to
            build a <A href=

            new search engine</A>.</P>
            <P>A good example of a charity that shut down due to poor expense control
            is <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Company">Kids Company</A>, a
            British charity for helping vulnerable children. The Kids Company debacle
            shows that shutdown can be quite abrupt. The British government provided
            most of the funding but (eventually) lost faith and ceased their annual
            grant which resulted in the charity being immediately liquidated. A House
            of Commons committee released <A href=

            <P>Mozilla's legal structure as a non-profit that owns a for-profit arm
